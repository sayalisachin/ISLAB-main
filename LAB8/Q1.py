'''Explanation:

    Dataset (documents): A list of 10 sample documents is created.
    AES Encryption/Decryption (encrypt_data/decrypt_data): Functions to encrypt and decrypt data using AES encryption.
    Inverted Index (build_inverted_index): A function to create an inverted index from the documents.
    Encrypting the Inverted Index (encrypt_index): The words in the inverted index are encrypted using AES encryption.
    Search Function (encrypt_query, search_encrypted_index): The search query is encrypted, and the encrypted index is searched for matches.
    Main Function: Handles user input, executes the search, and displays the results.

To run:

    Copy this code into a Python environment.
    You'll be prompted to enter a search query.
    The system will display matching documents based on the encrypted search.'''

'''It looks like the encryption of the search query and the encrypted index may not be matching due to the encryption process generating different ciphertexts for the same plaintext when using the AES Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode. In CBC mode, encryption produces different outputs even for the same plaintext due to the use of a unique initialization vector (IV) each time. This is likely why no documents were found for your search query.
Solution:

To fix this, we need to ensure that the same word (both in the index and query) is encrypted in a consistent manner. This can be done by encrypting only the word (query and index terms) with the same IV or using a deterministic encryption scheme (which produces the same ciphertext for the same input every time).

For simplicity, I'll modify the code to use AES Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode for encrypting the words in the inverted index and the query. In this mode, identical plaintext blocks are encrypted to identical ciphertext blocks, ensuring consistency for searching.
ECB Mode for Word Encryption: The encrypt_word_ecb function now uses AES.MODE_ECB to ensure that the same word gets the same encrypted value every time, making the search process work properly.
Inverted Index Encryption: The inverted index now encrypts the words using ECB mode.
Query Encryption: The search query is also encrypted using ECB mode, ensuring that the encryption matches the encrypted terms in the inverted index.'''
