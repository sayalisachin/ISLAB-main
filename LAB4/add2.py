"""Key Generation:

    The generate_vulnerable_rsa_keypair function creates an RSA key pair using small prime numbers pp and qq. The modulus nn is computed as n=p×qn=p×q, and the public exponent ee is chosen to be 17. The private exponent dd is calculated using the modular inverse.

Attack Function:

    The attack_rsa function attempts to factor the modulus nn to retrieve the prime factors pp and qq. It iterates through possible divisors up to nn

    ​. Once it finds pp, it calculates qq and verifies if qq is prime. If successful, it computes the private exponent dd.

Main Execution:

    The main function generates the vulnerable RSA keys and then attempts to attack the key pair to recover the private key."""


"""Suppose that XYZ Logistics has decided to use the RSA cryptosystem to secure 
their sensitive communications. However, the security team at XYZ Logistics has 
discovered that one of their employees, Eve, has obtained a partial copy of the 
RSA private key and is attempting to recover the full private key to decrypt the 
company's communications. 
Eve's  attack  involves  exploiting  a  vulnerability  in  the  RSA  key  generation 
process, where the prime factors (p and q) used to generate the modulus (n) are 
not sufficiently large or random. 
 Develop a Python script that can demonstrate the attack on the vulnerable RSA 
cryptosystem  
and discuss the steps to mitigate the attack.
