"""Explanation of the Code

    Initialization:
        The initial hash value is set to 5381.

    Iteration Over Characters:
        The function iterates over each character in the input string using a for loop.
        For each character, it retrieves the ASCII value using the ord() function.

    Hash Calculation:
        The hash value is updated by multiplying the current hash value by 33 and adding the ASCII value of the character.

    Bitwise Operations:
        The bitwise AND operation (&) with 0xFFFFFFFF is used to ensure that the hash value remains within a 32-bit range, effectively discarding any overflow.

    Return Value:
        The final computed hash value is returned."""

"""
Implement the hash function in Python. Your function should start with 
an initial hash value of 5381 and for each character in the input string, 
multiply  the  current  hash  value  by  33,  add  the  ASCII  value  of  the 
character, and use bitwise operations to ensure thorough mixing of the 
bits.  Finally,  ensure  the  hash  value  is  kept  within  a  32-bit  range  by 
applying an appropriate mask
